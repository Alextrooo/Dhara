**DHARA** is an open source software for distributed hydrology and river analysis. We designed it to be optimal for hybrid CPU-GPU parallel computing. 

This project aims to provide a consistent framework for scientists to use and futher develop  modules for their modeling purposes. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code and contribute your model to the community.
