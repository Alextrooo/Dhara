{\bfseries D\+H\+A\+RA} is an open source software for distributed hydrology and river analysis. We designed it to be optimal for hybrid C\+P\+U-\/\+G\+PU parallel computing.

This project aims to provide a consistent framework for scientists to use and futher develop modules for their modeling purposes. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code and contribute your model to the community.
